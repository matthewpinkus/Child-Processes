Year 2 Semester 1 Systems Programming Assignment 2

    Compiling and Running:
	  Non executable compiling:
          Save as2.c, changeword.c and file1.txt to the same directory (C drive is best)
          Through your terminal, navigate to the directory you saved the files (cd /mnt/c)
          To compile, type 'gcc -o main main.c' (this creates a new file called 'main')
          Type ./main file1.txt file2.txt to execute the program. (file2 can be any desired output name)
